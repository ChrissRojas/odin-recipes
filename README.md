# Odin Recipes
Hello! Over the next few days I will be using the Odin Project to recap on the fundamentals of HTML,CSS and Javascript.
As I already have skills in HTML and CSS. This is a practice document.
In retrospect to my previous projects, it may seem redudant to do be doing this but!
I'm not some superhuman that can remember everything so this is why practice is so important to me.
Plus this is a great way for me to practice some command line as well as HTML.
